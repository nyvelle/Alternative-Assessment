			<p> As shown in the images above, these are two of my favorite books. Miss Pergrine's Home for Peculiar
			<br>Children is on the top of my list because I'm inlove with mystery and fantasy fiction genre. 
			<br>Furthermore, I also have my interest in Tuesday's with Morrie because it's full of philosophical advices
			<br>that can be applied in our life. </p>
